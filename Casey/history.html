	<h3> My Family</h3>

	<p>

		My family is a third generation native of Atlanta, GA. My great grandparents from my mother’s side are from New Mexico and Maryland, and from my father’s side, Florida, and New York. My ancestors have been in the United States ever since it’s founding. They came over as indentured servants and worked very hard. I am related to a general on the American side during the Revolutionary War, General John Dent, as well as one of the signees of the Declaration of Independence, John Hancock. I am also related to Pocahontas (through marriage, not blood)! <a href="myFamilyTree.html"> Check It Out!</a>
